### About me

Hello everyone! My name is Bulat Karimov, and I am 23 years old. I am a C++ developer. My path in IT started with a project at Sberbank - School 21. As a beginner developer, I specialize in Qt and network programming. In the future, I plan to delve into game development using Unreal Engine.

I have been studying at School 21 for over a year and a half now. During this time, I have completed over 20 different projects, most of which were team efforts. In addition to this, I hold a secondary technical education as a software engineer and am currently pursuing a degree in the same field.

I successfully completed the Fast Track in Telecom internship. I am currently working as a C++ developer at "Tenet". In the future, I plan to continue improving my skills in Qt and network programming, as well as learning new technologies.

I am adept at searching for information and quickly learning new concepts.

‚ÄúA good specialist is not someone who knows a lot, but someone who knows how to seek information.‚Äù ‚Äî Somebody, once upon a time.
